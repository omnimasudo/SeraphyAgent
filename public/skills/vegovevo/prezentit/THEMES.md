## Using Themes

### With Theme ID
```json
{
  "topic": "Your topic",
  "theme": "minimalist",
  "stream": false
}
```

### With Custom Design Prompt
When no theme matches, use `customDesignPrompt`:

```json
{
  "topic": "Your topic",
  "customDesignPrompt": "Use a cyberpunk aesthetic with neon pink and cyan colors on dark backgrounds. Include futuristic UI elements and glitch effects.",
  "stream": false
}
```

## Theme Selection Logic

1. **User mentions a style?** → Search themes for it
2. **Match found?** → Use the theme `id`
3. **No match?** → Use `customDesignPrompt` with user's description
4. **Neither specified?** → Let AI choose based on topic

## Tips for AI Agents

- If user says "make it professional" → search "corporate" or "minimalist"
- If user says "make it fun" → search "creative" or "colorful"
- If user mentions specific colors → use `customDesignPrompt`
- When in doubt, `minimalist` is always a safe choice

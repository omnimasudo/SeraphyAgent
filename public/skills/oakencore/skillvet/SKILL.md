# Skillvet

Security scanner for agent skills. 37 critical checks, 8 warning checks. No dependencies — just bash and grep. Includes Tirith-inspired detection patterns, campaign signatures from [Koi Security research](https://www.koi.ai/blog/clawhavoc-341-malicious-clawedbot-skills-found-by-the-bot-they-were-targeting), and [1Password blog](https://1password.com/blog/from-magic-to-malware-how-openclaws-agent-skills-become-an-attack-surface) ClickFix patterns.

## Usage

**Safe install** (installs, audits, auto-removes if critical):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/safe-install.sh <skill-slug>
```

**Audit an existing skill:**

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh skills/some-skill
```

**Audit all installed skills:**

```bash
for d in skills/*/; do bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh "$d"; done
```

**JSON output** (for automation):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh --json skills/some-skill
```

**Summary mode** (one-line per skill):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh --summary skills/some-skill
```

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` warnings only, `2` critical findings.

## Critical Checks (auto-blocked)

### Core Security Checks (1-24)

| # | Check | Example |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | Known exfiltration endpoints | webhook.site, ngrok.io, requestbin |
| 2 | Bulk env variable harvesting | `printenv \|`, `${!*@}` |
| 3 | Foreign credential access | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN in scripts |
| 4 | Code obfuscation | eval(), base64 decode, hex escapes |
| 5 | Path traversal / sensitive files | `../../`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.clawdbot` |
| 6 | Data exfiltration via curl/wget | `curl --data`, `wget --post` with variables |
| 7 | Reverse/bind shells | `/dev/tcp/`, `nc -e`, `socat` |
| 8 | .env file theft | dotenv loading in scripts (not docs) |
| 9 | Prompt injection in markdown | "ignore previous instructions" in SKILL.md |
| 10 | LLM tool exploitation | Instructions to send/email secrets |
| 11 | Agent config tampering | Write/modify AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, clawdbot.json |
| 12 | Unicode obfuscation | Zero-width chars, RTL override, bidi control chars |
| 13 | Suspicious setup commands | curl piped to bash in SKILL.md |
| 14 | Social engineering | Download external binaries, paste-and-run instructions |
| 15 | Shipped .env files | .env files (not .example) in the skill |
| 16 | Homograph URLs *(Tirith)* | Cyrillic і vs Latin i in hostnames |
| 17 | ANSI escape sequences *(Tirith)* | Terminal escape codes in code/data files |
| 18 | Punycode domains *(Tirith)* | `xn--` prefixed IDN-encoded domains |
| 19 | Double-encoded paths *(Tirith)* | `%25XX` percent-encoding bypass |
| 20 | Shortened URLs *(Tirith)* | bit.ly, t.co, tinyurl.com hiding destinations |
| 21 | Pipe-to-shell | `curl \| bash` (HTTP and HTTPS) |
| 22 | String construction evasion | `'cu' + 'rl'`, `String.fromCharCode`, `getattr(os,...)` |
| 23 | Data flow chain analysis | Same file reads secrets, encodes, AND sends network requests |
| 24 | Time bomb detection | `Date.now() > timestamp`, `setTimeout(fn, 86400000)` |

### Campaign-Inspired Checks (25-34)

Inspired by [Koi Security research](https://www.koi.ai/blog/clawhavoc-341-malicious-clawedbot-skills-found-by-the-bot-they-were-targeting) which found 341 malicious skills on ClawHub.

| # | Check | Example |
|---|-------|---------|
| 25 | Known C2/IOC IP blocklist | 91.92.242.30, 54.91.154.110 (known AMOS C2 servers) |
| 26 | Password-protected archives | "extract using password: openclaw" — AV evasion |
| 27 | Paste service payloads | glot.io, pastebin.com hosting malicious scripts |
| 28 | GitHub releases binary downloads | Fake prerequisites pointing to `.zip`/`.exe` on GitHub |
| 29 | Base64 pipe-to-interpreter | `echo '...' \| base64 -D \| bash` — primary macOS vector |
| 30 | Subprocess + network commands | `os.system("curl ...")` — hidden pipe-to-shell in code |
| 31 | Fake URL misdirection *(warning)* | `echo "https://apple.com/setup"` decoy before real payload |
| 32 | Process persistence + network | `nohup curl ... &` — backdoor with network access |
| 33 | Fake prerequisite pattern | "Prerequisites" section with sketchy external downloads |
| 34 | xattr/chmod dropper | macOS Gatekeeper bypass: download → `xattr -c` → `chmod +x` → execute |

### 1Password Blog-Inspired Checks (35-37)

Inspired by [1Password research](https://1password.com/blog/from-magic-to-malware-how-openclaws-agent-skills-become-an-attack-surface) on ClickFix-style attacks targeting agent skills.

| # | Check | Example |
|---|-------|---------|
| 35 | ClickFix download+execute chain | `curl -o /tmp/x && chmod +x && ./x`, `open -a` with downloads |
| 36 | Suspicious package sources | `pip install git+https://...`, npm from non-official registries |
| 37 | Staged installer pattern | Fake dependency names like `openclaw-core`, `some-lib` |

### Severity Changes (v0.5.0)

- **Raw IP URLs** upgraded from WARNING → **CRITICAL** (malicious C2s commonly use raw IPs)
- **Pipe-to-shell** now catches both HTTP and HTTPS (not just insecure HTTP)

## Warning Checks (flagged for review)

| # | Check | Example |
|---|-------|---------|
| W1 | Unknown external tool requirements | Non-standard CLI tools in install instructions |
| W2 | Subprocess execution | child_process, exec(), os.system |
| W3 | Network requests | axios, fetch, requests imports |
| W4 | Minified/bundled files | First line >500 chars — can't audit |
| W5 | Filesystem write operations | writeFile, open('w'), fs.append |
| W6 | Insecure transport | `curl -k`, `verify=False` — TLS disabled |
| W7 | Docker untrusted registries | Non-standard image sources |

## Optional: Tirith Integration

If the [tirith](https://github.com/sheeki03/tirith) binary is available on PATH, the scanner will additionally extract all URLs from code files and run `tirith check` against each unique hostname for deeper homograph/IDN analysis. This is purely additive — the scanner works fine without tirith installed.

## IOC Updates

The C2 IP blocklist in check #25 is based on known indicators from:
- [Koi Security report](https://www.koi.ai/blog/clawhavoc-341-malicious-clawedbot-skills-found-by-the-bot-they-were-targeting) (Feb 2026)
- [The Hacker News coverage](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-find-341-malicious-clawhub.html)
- [OpenSourceMalware analysis](https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/clawdbot-skills-ganked-your-crypto)

To update IOCs, edit the `KNOWN_BAD_IPS` variable in `scripts/skill-audit.sh`.

## Limitations

Static analysis only. English-centric prompt injection patterns. Minified JS is flagged but not deobfuscated. A clean scan raises the bar but doesn't guarantee safety.

The scanner flags itself when audited — its own patterns contain the strings it detects. This is expected.
